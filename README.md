# @lowentry/utils

Provides utilities for general JavaScript development.


## Description

This plugin adds utility functions and classes to make it easier to program general JavaScript.

Think about things such as:

- looping through arrays and objects, indiscriminately
- ensuring that a value is of a certain type
- generating unique IDs
- trimming certain characters from the start and/or end of a string
- etc.

It's basically just a collection of general JavaScript utilities.


## Final words

I hope this plugin will be useful to you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch at [LowEntry.com](https://lowentry.com/).
